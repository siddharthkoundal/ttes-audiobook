            Swecha is a non-profit organisation founded to provide free software in India especially Andhra Pradesh. The organization is a social movement working towards educating the masses with the essence of free software and to provide knowledge to the commoners. 
            <br><br>Swecha launched quite a few initiatives and projects over the past few years in various domains. Their flagship domains include healthcare, aggrotech, ed-tech, civic-tech, webdev and assistive technologies. In civic tech their community has developed air quality monitoring system using past data and making new sensors. They also developed traffic and water info system. In assistive tech they added on to speech recognition and dialog system. Swecha Voice is an initiative to build a free software and privacy aware speech recognition system for Telugu. In the web development sector, they have developed the fake news detector which detects fake news articles going over in the internet. They also built the anti-gafam tech to get control over what info is shared with the big tech companies.
            They have also taken some major initiatives for social cause and making an impact or bringing about a change in the society. These include Code4change,
            BalaSwecha, GirlswhoCode and TechDays. <br><br>
            BalaSwecha is a free software project initiated by the Swecha for tiny tots. It is a school distro with many of the useful interactive applications for the school goers. Its stack is filled with educational suites for all the standards right from elementary to tenth standards. The aim of the Distro is to deliver a Free Software-based operating system for the project of “Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan” initiated by the government. There isn't such operating system till now which gives full freedom with an educational stack. Swecha has the plans of localizing BalaSwecha for the benefit of Telugu medium students
            <br><br>Girlswhocode provides a platform for women to code and introduce them to the digital domain, it is meant for rural areas where some people still don’t believe that girls can do anything they want to do.
            <br>E-Swecha is a free software project initiated by the Swecha and is aimed at developing a free Operating System, which is not built by a software firm, neither is it built by a few programmers.; it is a collaborative work of hundreds of Swecha Volunteers/engineering students in and around Hyderabad to, for and by the engineering students. These were some of the projects and initiatives of Swecha.
